This is a Python and [Torch](http://torch.ch) implementation of the CVPR 2015 paper
[FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/app/1A_089.pdf)
by Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin at Google
using publicly available libraries and datasets.
Torch allows the network to be executed on a CPU or with CUDA.

**Crafted by [Brandon Amos](http://bamos.github.io) in the
[Elijah](http://elijah.cs.cmu.edu) research group at
Carnegie Mellon University.**
