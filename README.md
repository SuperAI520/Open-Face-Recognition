# FaceNet

This is a Python and Torch implementation of the CVPR 2015 paper
[FaceNet: A Unified Embedding for Face Recognition and Clustering](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2015/app/1A_089.pdf)
by Florian Schroff, Dmitry Kalenichenko, and James Philbin at Google
using publicly available libraries and datasets.
Torch allows the network to be executed on a CPU or with CUDA.

[Elijah](http://elijah.cs.cmu.edu) research group at
Carnegie Mellon University.**

### Isn't face recognition a solved problem?
No! Accuracies from research papers have just begun to surpass
human accuracies on some benchmarks.
The accuracies of open source face recognition systems lag
behind the state-of-the-art.
See our accuracy comparisons on the famous LFW benchmark below.

The following example shows the workflow for a single input
image of Sylvestor Stallone from the publicly available
[LFW dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/person/Sylvester_Stallone.html).

1. Detect faces with a pre-trained models from
  [dlib](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/02/dlib-186-released-make-your-own-object.html)
  [OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html).
2. Transform the face for the neural network.
   This repository uses dlib's
   [real-time pose estimation](http://blog.dlib.net/2014/08/real-time-face-pose-estimation.html)
   with OpenCV's
   [affine transformation](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/imgproc/imgtrans/warp_affine/warp_affine.html)
   to try to make the eyes and nose appear in
   the same location on each image.
3. Use a deep neural network to represent (or embed) the face on
   a 128-dimensional unit hypersphere.
   The embedding is a generic representation for anybody's face.
   Unlike other face representations, this embedding has the nice property
   that a larger distance between two face embeddings means
   that the faces are likely not of the same person.
   This trivializes clustering, similarity detection,
   and classification tasks.

# Help Wanted!

As the following table shows, the forefront of deep learning research
is driven by large private datasets.
In face recognition, there are no open source implementations or
models trained on these datasets.
If you have access to a large dataset, we are very interested
in training a new FaceNet model with it.
Please contact Brandon Amos at [bamos@cs.cmu.edu](mailto:bamos@cs.cmu.edu).

# Real-Time Web Demo
See [our YouTube video](TODO) of using this in a real-time web application
for face recognition.
The source is available in [examples/web](/examples/web).

TODO: Screenshot

From the `examples/web` directory, install requirements
with `./install-deps.sh` and `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt`.

# Comparison Demo
Use `./demos/compare.py` to compute the squared Euclidean
distance of faces found in two images.

# Cool demos, but I want numbers. What's the accuracy?
Even though the public datasets we trained on have orders of magnitude less data
than private industry datasets, the accuracy is remarkably high and
outperforms all other open-source face recognition implementations we
are aware of on the standard
[LFW](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/results.html)
benchmark.
We had to fallback to using the deep funneled versions for
152 of 13233 images because dlib failed to detect a face or landmarks.

TODO: ROC Curve

This can be generated with the following commands from the root `facenet`
directory, assuming you have downloaded and placed the raw and
deep funneled lfw data from [here](http://http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/)
in `./data/lfw/raw` and `./data/lfw/deepfunneled`.

1. Install prerequisites as below.
2. Preprocess the raw `lfw` images, change `8` to however many
   separate processes you want to run:
   `for N in {1..8}; do ./util/align-dlib.py data/lfw/raw align affine data/lfw/dlib-affine-sz:96 --size 96 &; done`.
   Fallback to deep funneled versions for images that dlib failed
   to align:
   `./util/align-dlib.py data/lfw/raw align affine data/lfw/dlib-affine-sz:96 --size 96 --fallbackLfw data/lfw/deepfunneled`
3. Generate representations with `./batch-represent/main.lua -outDir evaluation/lfw.nn4.v1.reps -model models/facenet/nn4.v1.t7 -data data/lfw/dlib-affine-sz:96`
4. Generate the ROC curve from the `evaluation` directory with `./lfw-roc.py --workDir lfw.nn4.v1.reps`.
   This creates `roc.pdf` in the `lfw.nn4.v1.reps` directory.

# Setup
The following instructions are for Linux and OSX only.
Please contribute modifications and build instructions if you
are interested in running this on other operating systems.

## Check out git submodules
Clone with `--recursive` or run `git submodule init && git submodule update`
after checking out.

## Download the models
Run `./models/get-models.sh` to download pre-trained FaceNet
models on the combined CASIA-WebFace and FaceScrub database.
This also downloads dlib's pre-trained model for face landmark detection.

## With Docker
TODO

Be sure you have checked out the submodules and downloaded the models as
described above.

This repo can be deployed as a container with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
for CPU mode:

```
sudo docker build -t facenet .
sudo docker run -t -i -v $PWD:/facenet facenet /bin/bash
cd /facenet
TODO
```

To use, place your images in `facenet` on your host and
access them from the shared Docker directory.

## By hand
Be sure you have checked out the submodules and downloaded the models as
described above.

The main dependencies from a package manager are Torch and Python 2.
Afterwards, manually install the following.

### OpenCV
Download [OpenCV 2.4.11](https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/2.4.11.zip)
and follow their
[build instructions](http://docs.opencv.org/doc/tutorials/introduction/linux_install/linux_install.html).

### dlib
Download [dlib v18.16](https://github.com/davisking/dlib/releases/download/v18.16/dlib-18.16.tar.bz2).

```
cd ~/src
tar xf dlib-18.16.tar.bz2
cd dlib-18.16/python_examples
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../../tools/python
cmake --build . --config Release
cp dlib.so ..
```

### Torch
Install [Torch](http://torch.ch) from the instructions on their website
and install the [dpnn](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dpnn)
and [nn](https://github.com/torch/nn) libraries with
`luarocks install dpnn` and `luarocks install nn`.

If you want CUDA support, also install
[cudnn.torch](https://github.com/soumith/cudnn.torch).
